## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in fostering an interactive and engaging learning environment where students are encouraged to think critically and apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems. My teaching approach emphasizes:

1. Hands-on learning experiences
2. Real-world applications
3. Interactive discussions
4. Individual attention
5. Continuous feedback
